This directory should contain mark pascal clearing rules files which I
obviously don't want to post up onto github. The easiest way to go is
to tar up the rules dir from dev/templates/rules, untar if here, then
from the parent directory run:

$ make rename_rules

This will convert all the nasty mark pascal filenames into unix
friendly ones.
